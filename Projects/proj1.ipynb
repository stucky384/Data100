    "There is only 1 mode, 100, it has a skew to the left, there are some gaps around 90-100. This means that there were no restaurants that recieved some scores such as 99. This could be because due to several reasons, one such being that the scoring process itself makes getting values such as 99 hard. One thing to notice is that as the score decreases, the fewer counts there are. This could also be due to several factors such as, if a restaurant has a low score, it will likely be closed down/go out of business, thus restaurants with lower scores don't survive."

It should be exactly the same as `ins`, except that it should have the name and address of every business, as determined by the `bus` dataframe. If a `business_id` in `ins` does not exist in `bus`, the name and address should be given as NaN.\n",
